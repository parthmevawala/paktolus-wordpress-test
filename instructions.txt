I have created shortcodes for this task.
1. [hippo_form] : This is where the form will be listed.
2. [hippo_quote] : This is where the quote_premium will be reflected. This can be kept on same, as well as any other page.


ISSUES:
While accessing the API, I have faced CORS issue. Your site was not allowing me to access the API from fetch url (JS).
So, due to this, I have kept static response for quote premium.
Rest all is properly done.
